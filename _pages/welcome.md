Hi 👋, I am George Petropoulos. My greek name is Giorgos or Yiorgos or Yorgos (greek: Γιώργος), a common abbreviation of my birth name [Georgios (greek: Γεώργιος)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios). 

I am based in Athens, Greece and I am currently working as an engineering manager in [Chartmogul](https://chartmogul.com). Having worked in lots of different domains (analytics, fintech, hiring, AI, R&D in multiple fields) I consider myself a versatile person who will understand the business and figure out what it's needed to improve it. I am an executor and problem solver by nature, and I always aim to help and encourage my team and colleagues to learn and grow themselves. 

I have worked and experimented with lots of data engineering tools, databases, programming languages, libraries and cloud services. I am currently working on Clickhouse, Snowflake and dbt and understand how I can improve Chartmogul's data architecture.

I am documenting my experiences from life, data engineering and engineering in general, while also maintaining my cv into the [Resume](/cv) page. This way I hope to improve my technical (and not only) writing.
