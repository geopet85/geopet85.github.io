Hi 👋, i am George Petropoulos. My greek name is Giorgos or Yiorgos or Yorgos (greek: Γιώργος), a common abbreviation of my birth name [Georgios (greek: Γεώργιος)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Georgios). 

I am based in Athens, Greece and i am currently working as a data engineering tech lead in an awesome company called [Chartmogul](https://chartmogul.com). Having worked in lots of different domains (AI, gaming, fintech, hiring, analytics) i consider myself a versatile person who will understand the business and figure out what it's needed to improve it. I am an executor and problem solver by nature, and i always aim to help and encourage my team and colleagues to learn and grow themselves. 

I have worked and experimented with lots of data engineering tools, databases, programming languages, libraries and cloud services. I am currently working on the modern data stack (Snowflake and dbt) and understand how i can improve Chartmogul's internal tooling and methodologies.
